# Whoami?

I’m a **Cloud Engineer** based in Móstoles, Madrid, with over 15 years of experience in production systems. I specialize in the design, construction, and maintenance of cloud architectures for various companies and organizations. 

My expertise spans across AWS, and I have played a key role in helping companies transition from on-premise and traditional solutions to cloud-based systems, empowering them with enhanced agility and efficiency managing their infrastructure.

In addition to my cloud expertise, I have a strong background in **DevOps** practices, which has allowed me to significantly improve delivery speed and quality through automation and streamlined processes. My experience in production environments gives me a solid understanding of the critical needs of businesses, such as availability, reliability, and security, enabling me to design cloud solutions that address these challenges while ensuring a seamless transition and successful implementation.

In my free time, I’m passionate about sharing my knowledge with others. I actively participate in local tech communities, hosting workshops and talks about cloud technologies and DevOps methodologies. I'm also a proud contributor to open-source projects and frequently engage with others in the tech space to exchange ideas and foster collaboration.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar and spending time with my family, including my wife and my daughters in Móstoles. I’m an avid sports fan, especially when it comes to Formula 1, NBA, NFL, and NHL. I also train and play basketball in the small forward position, always striving to improve my skills, both on and off the court.
