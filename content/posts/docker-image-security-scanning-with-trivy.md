# Docker image security scanning with Trivy

Security in container images has become one of the most critical aspects of maintaining a secure and resilient containerized environment. As more organizations embrace containerization for its scalability, portability, and efficiency, the need to ensure that the containers are secure has grown exponentially. Container images, when built improperly or left unmonitored, can become a significant vector for cyberattacks, leading to vulnerabilities that expose systems and data to threats.

[Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) is an open-source vulnerability scanner specifically designed to address this concern. [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) simplifies the process of scanning container images, as well as other artifacts such as Helm charts, Kubernetes resources or Git repositories, for known vulnerabilities. Analyzing the underlying components of an image, including operating system packages, libraries, and dependencies, and cross-references them against an up-to-date vulnerability database.

What sets Trivy apart is its ease of use and speed. It’s designed to work out of the box with minimal setup, enabling users to quickly identify and mitigate security risks without the complexity often associated with other security tools. This simplicity, coupled with its depth of scanning and broad ecosystem support, has made Trivy a go-to tool in the DevOps community for integrating vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

If you don’t have [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) installed yet, you can install on macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install trivy
```

Once the installation is complete, verify that the [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) installation was successful by entering the following command in the terminal:

```bash
trivy --version
Version: 0.59.1
```

### Scanning for vulnerabilities

When you run the [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) command to scan for vulnerabilities in your container images, [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) first ensures that it has the most up-to-date vulnerability database by downloading the relevant data. It then performs a thorough comparison, scanning the components of your container image—including operating system packages, libraries, and dependencies—against the vulnerabilities listed in the database. This allows [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) to identify and report any known security risks within the image.

[Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) categorizes the identified vulnerabilities into different severity levels to help you prioritize your response:

- **Critical:** These vulnerabilities represent the **highest level of risk** and need to be addressed immediately. They typically allow attackers to gain administrative control over the system, which can lead to full compromise of the container or even the underlying host. Critical vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to the integrity and security of your environment, and they should be fixed without delay to prevent severe security breaches.

- **High:** High-risk vulnerabilities are serious and should be prioritized promptly. While they may not give attackers full control over the system, they increase the likelihood of data leakage, unauthorized access, or other forms of exploitation. These vulnerabilities could potentially result in sensitive data being exposed or allow attackers to manipulate the system in ways that are damaging to your organization's security posture. It's crucial to resolve these as quickly as possible to minimize potential damage.

- **Medium:**  Medium-level vulnerabilities may not present an immediate or catastrophic threat but still warrant attention. These types of issues could result in the unavailability of the system or application for users, potentially leading to service disruptions or downtime. While not as urgent as critical or high risks, they should be addressed within a reasonable timeframe to maintain system stability and user experience.

- **Low:** Low-risk vulnerabilities generally have a limited impact on system security and typically don’t pose an immediate threat. These vulnerabilities can often be addressed during regular maintenance or as part of routine updates and patching. While they should not be ignored, they do not require immediate action and can be resolved during less urgent security or system updates.

By classifying vulnerabilities into these categories, [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/) provides a clear and actionable way to prioritize remediation efforts based on the severity of each issue and helps teams take appropriate action, ensuring that the most critical vulnerabilities are patched first while allowing for a more measured approach to lower-severity risks.
