# Overview

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a container orchestration tool that provides a declarative way to define your entire application stack. While individual Docker containers are powerful, real-world applications often require multiple interconnected services - perhaps a web server, a database, a caching layer, and various microservices. While Docker allows you to run single containers, often in modern applications, you need to manage multiple containers that work together and managing these containers individually would be cumbersome and error-prone.

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) helps you simplifying Docker workflows:

- **Multi-container Management** Many applications require multiple services to run—such as a web server, database, caching system, and message queue. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) allows you to manage all these containers with a single configuration file, simplifying the process of orchestrating complex environments.

- **Simplified Setup:** [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) helps you define how each container should behave, how they are connected, and what dependencies they have on each other, simplifiying the setup process and  allowing you to quickly deploy and test your entire application stack locally.

- **Consistency Across Environments:** By using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), you ensure that the same configuration is used across all environments—development, testing, and production. This consistency reduces the chances of issues when deploying applications.

- **Automation:** [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) automates the process of building, deploying, and managing multi-container environments with simple commands like ```docker compose up```, you can bring up an entire application stack in seconds.
